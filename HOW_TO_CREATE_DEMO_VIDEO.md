## Adding Video to ARTIQ Landing Page

Once you have your video:

1. **Upload to YouTube** (unlisted or public)
2. **Get embed code**
3. **Add to login_screen.dart** (I can help with this)
4. **Or use a GIF** - Convert video to GIF at ezgif.com

## Quick Win: Create a GIF Instead

If video feels too complicated, start with an animated GIF:

1. Record 10-15 seconds of ARTIQ in action
2. Go to ezgif.com/video-to-gif
3. Upload your video
4. Optimize (reduce size to under 5MB)
5. Download GIF

GIFs are easier to embed and load faster than videos!
